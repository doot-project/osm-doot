# Growtopia Private Server (GTPS) Documentation

> Complete technical documentation for building a Growtopia Private Server from scratch.

## What is GTPS?

Growtopia is a 2D MMO sandbox game (originally by Seth Robinson & Hamumu Software, now Ubisoft). A **Growtopia Private Server** emulates the official game protocol so the unmodified retail client connects to your custom server instead.

The client uses **ENet** (reliable UDP) for gameplay and **HTTPS** for the initial login handshake. By redirecting DNS (or editing the hosts file), the client talks to your server transparently.

## Reference Implementations

The protocol facts and binary layouts in these docs are cross-referenced
against four working private servers. When something is documented as
"verified", it means at least two of these sources agree:

| Server | Path | Strength |
|--------|------|----------|
| **NiceTopia** | `D:\NiceTopia-Project2\Source` (this repo) | Largest fork (~800KB Source.cpp); covers most edge cases |
| **Gurotopia** | `D:\artefak\Gurotopia-master` | Newest reference (Dec 2025); items.dat v25/v26, modern dialog builder |
| **Windsverse** | `D:\artefak\WINDSVERSE\WINDSVERSE\source` | Tightly written `ItemsManager`, classic inventory packing |
| **GTServer / HappyPS** | `D:\GTServer\GTServer` | Compact ENet wrapper, useful for verifying ENet config |

For items.dat field-by-field analysis, see also `tools/itemsdat-codec/` (this
repo) which has been validated for round-trip identity on v18 and v21 files
and synthesizes correct v22-v26 output.

## Architecture Overview

```
                    +-------------------+
                    |  Growtopia Client |
                    +--------+----------+
                             |
              +--------------+--------------+
              |                             |
     HTTPS POST (login)            ENet UDP (gameplay)
              |                             |
              v                             v
   +----------+----------+      +-----------+-----------+
   | HTTP Server         |      | Game Server           |
   | /growtopia/         |      | Port 17091            |
   | server_data.php     |      | ENet + CRC32 +        |
   | Returns IP:port     |      | Range Coder           |
   +---------------------+      +-----------------------+
                                            |
                                            v
                                 +----------+----------+
                                 | Database            |
                                 | (players, worlds)   |
                                 +---------------------+
```

## Tech Stack

```
Transport    ENet (reliable UDP) with CRC32 checksum + Range Coder compression
Login        HTTPS POST to /growtopia/server_data.php
Game Data    Binary protocol (56-byte tank packets) + pipe-delimited text
Item DB      items.dat (~5-8 MB binary, served once, cached by client)
Default Port 17091 UDP
```

## Minimum Viable Server (Checklist)

```
[x] HTTP endpoint returning server IP + port
[x] ENet host with CRC32 + Range Coder + usingNewPacketForServer enabled
[x] Send SERVER_HELLO on client connect
[x] Parse client login data (GENERIC_TEXT)
[x] Validate or create player account
[x] Send OnSuperMainStart variant (items.dat hash, CDN, settings)
[x] Serve items.dat binary (SEND_ITEM_DATABASE_DATA)
[x] Handle action|enter_game
[x] Handle action|join_request -> generate world -> send SEND_MAP_DATA
[x] Send OnSpawn for all players in world (with type|local for the joiner)
[x] Send SEND_INVENTORY_STATE
[x] Handle PACKET_STATE (movement) and broadcast to others
[x] Handle TILE_CHANGE_REQUEST (place/break) and broadcast
[x] Handle disconnect -> save player, broadcast OnRemove
```

## Common Mistakes

| Symptom | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| Client disconnects immediately | CRC32 or Range Coder not enabled, or `usingNewPacketForServer` not set |
| Client ignores packets | Packet exceeds 16384 bytes header limit |
| Text packet fails | Missing null terminator |
| Client re-downloads items.dat every login | Hash mismatch in OnSuperMainStart |
| Players invisible to each other | net_id not unique per world |
| Player appears at wrong position | Using tile coords instead of pixels (pixel = tile * 32) |
| Variant call does nothing | Index 0 is not a string (must be function name) |
| Extended data missing | EXTENDED flag (0x08) not set in tank packet |
| Inventory pane empty | Wrong header — `item_count` is uint32, not uint16 |
| Byte corruption | Not using Little-Endian byte order |

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [itemsdat-codec](tools/itemsdat-codec/) | items.dat decoder/encoder (Node.js, zero deps, full v11–v26 support, future-proof v27+ via `_unknownTrailingData`) |
