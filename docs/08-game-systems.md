## Farming & Splicing

### How Farming Works

1. Plant a seed on an empty tile (or on Dirt, item 610)
2. Each seed has a `growTime` in seconds (defined in items.dat)
3. Fruit count on plant: **1-4 random** (rarity 999 items always produce exactly 1)
4. When `current_time - planted_time >= growTime`, tree is ready
5. Punch the tree to harvest

### Harvest Results

- Drops the block version of the seed (item_id - 1), count = fruit count
- **21% chance** to also drop a seed back
- Gem drop: `rand() % (item.max_gems + 1)` gems (if item has max_gems > 0)
- XP gained: `item.rarity / 5` (minimum 1)

### Grow Time Modifiers

| Source | Reduction |
|--------|-----------|
| Ancestral items (5082-5170) | 8%-13% depending on item |
| Hand item 6846 | 2% |
| PlayMod 118 (Food: Tree Growth) | 5% |
| Grow Pass | Additional 5% multiplier |
| Machine 9844 (with fuel) | 25% |

### Splicing

Place a seed on a tile that already has a different seed planted. The server looks up the recipe:

- Searches all items for matching `r_1`/`r_2` recipe pairs
- On match: tile becomes the result seed, marked as spliced, timer resets
- Cannot splice if tree is already fully grown
- Cannot splice if tile already has 3 seeds (double-spliced)

Hardcoded special splices: `339+627→742`, `743+253→758`, `743+285→6674`

### Harvest Bonuses

| Source | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| Guild level 8 | +10% yield |
| Guild level 16 | +20% yield |
| Guild level 24 | +30% yield |
| Magic Magnet (back item 8908) | Auto-collect to inventory (1/250 chance of breaking into item 8940) |
| PlayMod 14 (Lucky) | 30% chance of extra 1-5 gems |
| Harvest Festival event | Chance of mooncake drops based on rarity |

## Lock System

### Lock Types

**Area Locks** (protect a fixed number of tiles around the lock):

| Item | ID | Tile Coverage |
|------|----|---------------|
| Small Lock | 202 | 10 tiles |
| Big Lock | 204 | 48 tiles |
| Huge Lock | 206 | 200 tiles |
| Builder's Lock | 4994 | Area lock with build-only mode |

**World Locks** (protect the entire world):

| Item | ID | Notes |
|------|----|-------|
| World Lock | 242 | Costs 3000 gems, recycles for 300 |
| Diamond Lock | 5814 | Premium world lock |
| Royal Lock | 4802 | Extra options: Silence Peasants, Royal Rainbows |

Any lock with `BlockTypes::LOCK` that isn't in the area lock list (202, 204, 206, 4994, 10000) functions as a world lock.

### Access Check Order

1. World owner → full access
2. World admins (in `world.admins` list) → access
3. Area lock owner → access to their locked tiles
4. Area lock admins (in `block.admins` list) → access
5. Public flag set → anyone can build/break

### Lock Settings (wrench menu)

```
Allow anyone to Build and Break    (public toggle)
Allow admins to edit vending
Allow admins to edit magplant
Block picking up items
Disable Cheater Role
Disable Custom Music Blocks
Set as Home World
Minimum entry level                (world level requirement)
```

### Flow

1. Use bait on water tile → starts fishing timer
2. Wait for `fish_seconds` to pass
3. Reel in → random item from rod's `randomitem[]` array

## Surgery

3. Player performs surgery mini-game (select correct tools)
4. Success/fail based on skill check

### Skill System

- `surgery_skill` ranges 0-100
- Increases by 1 on each successful cure
- Fail chance: `30 - (surgery_skill / 4)` percent

### Maladies (randomly assigned)

Broken arm, broken leg, bird flu, turtle flu, monkey flu, nose job, lung tumor, heart attack, brain tumor, liver infection, kidney failure, appendicitis, swallowed World Lock, herniated disc, broken everything, serious head injury, serious trauma, massive trauma, torn punching muscle, gem cuts, Grumbleteeth, chicken feet, broken heart, brain worms, ecto bones, Moldy Guts

## Geiger Counter

- `geiger_` counter increments per punch (0-100%)
- At 100%: resets, gives back charged item

### Item Chain

```
Uncharged → 2286 (Geiger Counter) → 2204 (Geiger Counter: Charged)
Alternate: → 2560 → 2558
```

### PlayMod

- Expired mods are removed on next tick/check

---

## World Flags

Defined as a bitmask (`uint32_t`):

```cpp
enum eWorldFlags {
    WORLDFLAG_NUKED              = (1 << 0),   // 1
    WORLDFLAG_RESTRICT_NOCLIP    = (1 << 1),   // 2
    WORLDFLAG_JAMMED             = (1 << 2),   // 4
    WORLDFLAG_PUNCH_JAMMER       = (1 << 3),   // 8
    WORLDFLAG_ZOMBIE_JAMMER      = (1 << 4),   // 16
    WORLDFLAG_ANTI_GRAVITY       = (1 << 5),   // 32
    WORLDFLAG_BALLOON_JAMMED     = (1 << 6),   // 64
    WORLDFLAG_MINI_MOD           = (1 << 7),   // 128
    WORLDFLAG_GUARDIAN_PINEAPPLE = (1 << 8),   // 256
    WORLDFLAG_NOLOCKS            = (1 << 9),   // 512
    WORLDFLAG_HAUNTED            = (1 << 10),  // 1024
    WORLDFLAG_NOGO               = (1 << 11),  // 2048
    WORLDFLAG_NOEVENTS           = (1 << 12),  // 4096
};
```

These are set/cleared by placing or removing specific jammer items in the world.

### NiceTopia Implementation (alternative)

NiceTopia uses `active_jammers` vector (item IDs) instead of a bitmask:

```
Item 226   → "JAMMED" (Signal Jammer)
Item 1276  → "NOPUNCH" (Punch Jammer)
Item 1278  → "IMMUNE" (Zombie Jammer)
Item 4884  → "NOWAR"
Other      → "ANTIGRAVITY"
```

---

## Achievements

- Stored as `map<string, int>` — achievement title → progress count
- Total: **169** achievements tracked
- Accessible via `/alist` command or profile wrench
- Actual achievement definitions/criteria are loaded from external data (not hardcoded in examined source)

---

## Crime System

> Only `BlockTypes::CRIME_VILLAIN` enum exists in the source. No crime gameplay logic is implemented in the examined codebases. The block type appears decorative/placeholder only.
